      # for general locations are almost useless. For example, the geocoded
      # coordinates for "United States" is located in Kansas, which is middle of
      # the country. This means that a search for "hackathons near United States"
      # is really a search for "hackathons near Kansas". So, we only search for
      # nearby hackathons if the location is specific enough (has a most
      # significant component of city).
