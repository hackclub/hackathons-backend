    # In order to get accurate "nearby" searches, we must have accurate
    # coordinates. Generally, coordinates obtained via geocoding are only
    # accurate when the input address is very specific. And geocoded coordinates
    # for general locations are almost useless. For example, the geocoded
    # coordinates for "United States" is located in Kansas, which is middle of
    # the country. This means that a search for "hackathons near United States"
    # is really a search for "hackathons near Kansas". So, we only search for
    # nearby hackathons if the location is specific enough (has a most
    # significant component of city).
